# Project TODO List

This document tracks planned features, improvements, and bug fixes.

### Authentication & Collaboration
- [ ] Implement GitHub OAuth authentication
- [ ] Add user profiles and project permissions
- [ ] Create project sharing functionality
- [ ] Integrate with GitHub Projects for task management

### Core Features
- [ ] Implement waveform export functionality
- [ ] Add support for multiple testbench runs
- [ ] Improve error reporting with detailed stack traces
- [ ] Integrate Yosys for synthesis and optimization

## Known Issues
- [ ] Module detection can be slow with large codebases
- [ ] Vercel has a session timeout after 10secs and thus doesn't run simulation if too long.

## Future Ideas
- AI-assisted testbench generation (?)
- Integration with other EDA tools
- Real-time simulation debugging tools
